NOTE:
make a temporary upload img for qr code on student assistant side to showcase how the qr code gets scanned
(just to show 'completed' status)


TO DO LATER:
- non-approved students can only view reg form
- 

Colors:
BLUE             - rgb(37, 52, 117)
YELLOW           - rgb(242, 199, 0)
YELLOW (W/ BLUE) - rgb(243, 203, 16)


FOLDER STRUCTURE:
- install HTML5 QR CODE via NPM ❌
- DOUBLE CHECK NOTIFCATIONS.JS KUNG MAY PURPOSE, DEL IF WALA


FORMS (ALL):
- Add validation and restrictions in input fields accordingly. ❌
- MAKE SURE TO APPLY SWEETALERT TO ALL POPUPS ❌


STUDENT FOLDER:
have an enrollment.php for view enrollment button when clicked. but should still have consistent design like the dahsboard.php and structure.


=====================================

for use of css it will be bootstrap, no internal css, just use custom.css for that if ever. i encourage you to reuse classes for consistency. kindly focus on these adjustments for now. thank you.
